# Convolutional-Neural-Network-for-Image-Classification
🔍 Problem Statement
--------------------
How can we enable machines to recognize and classify images efficiently and accurately?The goal is to develop a deep learning model that can process image data and achieve high accuracy in recognizing patterns and classes within the dataset.

📁 Dataset

The project uses a sample image dataset consisting of multiple classes.Example datasets could include CIFAR-10, MNIST, or a custom collection of categorized images (unspecified in the notebook, but structured image data was used).

🧠 Approach
-----------

1.  Imported necessary libraries and set up the environment.
    
2.  Preprocessed the image dataset — normalization, reshaping, and labeling.
    
3.  Designed the CNN architecture with convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.
    
4.  Compiled the model using appropriate loss functions and optimizers.
    
5.  Trained the model on the training dataset and validated using a test set.
    
6.  Evaluated model performance and plotted training vs validation accuracy.
